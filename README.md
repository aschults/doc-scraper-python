# Doc Scraper 

Python modules supporting the extraction of semi-structured data from Google Docs
to make it available in structured or table form.

Example:

Multiple teams copy and fill in the same Google Docs template. The template
requires information to be filled into some table, repeated for multiple items,
each under a separate subsection.

Doc Scraper will simplify the extraction of heading/section titles and the relevant 
cells in each section to get to a simple table, one record per section.
